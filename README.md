A list of the hidden gems of the gaming world, following the awesome list format. Feel free to add any console or game you wish. I'm being a bit loose with what games you can add as long as it's overlooked and not mainstream it can be here even if it's a port of a popular game. Just create a pull request by editing the read me and I'll commit it as long as it follows the format. If a console isn't on this list feel free to add the section for it even if you don't have a game to contribute.

## XBOX
-[Conker: Live & Reloaded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conker:_Live_%26_Reloaded)- An overlooked port due to the increased censoring, otherwise as good if not better than the original. Recommended if you can't get into the N64 graphics.
